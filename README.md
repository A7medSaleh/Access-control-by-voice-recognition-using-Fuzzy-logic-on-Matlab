Speech recognition is one of the important areas in digital speech processing. The conventional methods for speech recognition are very complicated and time consuming. Using Fuzzy Logic proved to be the most efficient and fast method.

This code is implemented in MATLAB to use voice recognition as access control or voice password with simple training code that need to be done only once for every new user and another code that gives access only to the user the model trained to.
